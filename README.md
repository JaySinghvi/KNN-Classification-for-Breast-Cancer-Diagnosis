# KNN Classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
1. Developed a robust KNN model to classify breast cancer diagnoses using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, optimizing the model through repeated cross-validation.
2. Executed thorough data preprocessing including normalization and addressing class imbalance, ensuring balanced and accurate predictions.
3. Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal number of neighbors (k=7), achieving a model accuracy of 96.4%.
4. Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, demonstrating a high accuracy rate of 97.18% and a Kappa statistic of 0.939, indicating strong agreement between predictions and actual outcomes.
5. Analyzed model performance with detailed metrics, highlighting a low misclassification rate of 2.82%, a false positive rate of 2.1%, and a false negative rate of 0.7%, prioritizing the minimization of false negatives due to their critical impact on patient diagnosis.
