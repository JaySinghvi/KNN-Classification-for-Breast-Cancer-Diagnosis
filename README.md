Developed a high-accuracy KNN model to classify breast cancer diagnoses using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. Through data preprocessing, normalization, and class balancing, the model achieved 96.4% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning identified **k=7** as optimal, leading to 97.18% accuracy and a Kappa statistic of 0.939. The model's performance was evaluated with a confusion matrix, revealing a **2.82% misclassification rate**, **false positive rate of 2.1%**, and **false negative rate of 0.7%**, with a focus on minimizing false negatives for improved diagnostic reliability.
